Node and Express Dating App

This repository is for a full stack JavaScript application using Node, HTML, and .json files. The application allows the client to interact with a server to submit data, compare that to the data of other clients, and be matched to someone with similar personality traits. This project was created and is maintained by Miguel Galarraga.

The app is deployed at: https://desolate-springs-10066.herokuapp.com/
